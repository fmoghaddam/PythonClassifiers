The Sun reported that the royal family is also considering proposals to remove the monarch as temporal head of the Church of England, and to give women equal rights as heirs to the throne. Currently, the monarch is succeeded by his or her eldest son, whose own son is next in line for the throne before any of his sisters. Younger sons and their children are next in line, followed by any daughters of the monarch.
