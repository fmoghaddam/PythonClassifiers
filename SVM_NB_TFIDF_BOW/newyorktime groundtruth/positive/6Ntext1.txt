A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said yesterday that QUEEN ELIZABETH II and other members of the royal family are discussing possible changes in Britain's 1,200-year-old  monarchy. The palace refused to specify what issues the 70-year-old queen, her husband, PRINCE PHILIP, and the heir to the throne, PRINCE CHARLES, have taken up in their talks with senior aides.
