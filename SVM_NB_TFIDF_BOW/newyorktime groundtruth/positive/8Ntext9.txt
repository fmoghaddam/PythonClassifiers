Dr. Crucitti, who headed one of the Gemelli Hospital's three surgical units at the time, had been examining patients in a nearby hospital when a nun told him that the Pope had been shot. On the way to the Gemelli Hospital, where the Pope had been taken by ambulance from the scene of the shooting at the Vatican, Dr. Crucitti is said to have stopped a policeman to ask for an escort, pleading, ''I am the surgeon who will operate on the Pope.''
