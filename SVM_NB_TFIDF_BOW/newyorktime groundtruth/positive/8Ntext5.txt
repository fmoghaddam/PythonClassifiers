Dr. Crucitti had last operated on the Pope in 1996, when he performed a 50-minute operation at the Catholic University Agostino Gemelli Hospital, on the edge of Rome, to remove the Pope's appendix. Four years earlier, when John Paul was 72, Dr. Crucitti performed an operation of almost four hours to excise a large tumor from the Pope's colon and to remove his gall bladder.
