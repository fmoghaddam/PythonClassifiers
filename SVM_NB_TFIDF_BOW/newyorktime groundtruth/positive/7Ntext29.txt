The only way the Pope could enter Sarajevo by air would be along the flight path used by United Nations relief flights, which are frequently suspended because of antiaircraft fire. Mr. Karazdic has suggested that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces could try to shoot down the Pope's plane and then blame the Bosnian Serbs. And once he is in the city, the Pope, who is considered by many Serbs to have supported their adversaries, would be in range of sniper fire.
