The Pope, who had come into Rome today from his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo for a regular weekly audience, later traveled to Dr. Crucitti's home near the center of the city to offer condolences to his widow, Alessandra, and the couple's three children. The Pope said he had come ''to show you in some way my appreciation for this man who saved my life.''
